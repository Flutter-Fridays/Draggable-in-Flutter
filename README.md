# Draggable-in-Flutter
In this repository, we teach you how to use draggable in Flutter.

## What is Draggable?
It's a widget that can be dragged and move around the screen. 
When a draggable widget recognizes the start of a drag gesture, it displays a feedback widget that tracks the user's finger across the screen. 
If the user lifts their finger while on top of a DragTarget, that target is given the opportunity to accept the data carried by the draggable.
